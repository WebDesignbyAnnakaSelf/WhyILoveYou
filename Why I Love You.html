		<p>The date was October 24, 2020. It only took a single letter for me to be aching for the next one. I wasn't looking for anything special, but great things happen when you least expect them, but when you need them the most. I didn't know how much I needed you untill I couldn't imagine a world without you. </p>

		<p class="lettersbody">Hello! I hope you’re having a wonderful day today! I see that you and I have several things in common. I hope that you and I can be friends! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Henry, I’m a 16 year old kid from Georgia (the state not the country) and I’m currently living abroad in the Dominican Republic. The reason why I’m here is mainly because my parents were looking for a job after the 2008 recession and since we knew people in the DR so we decided to live here, I plan on going back to America once I’m 18. Georgia is a wonderful state with nice people and warm weather, the DR is eh, its ok but you gotta be careful since people here don't like foreigners, the beaches are nice tho. Some of the stuff I like to do in my free time is exercising, reading, cycling, and playing videogames. What are some of the things you like to do? I see you're interested in religion as well, are you a Christian as well? I hope to hear back from you soon!</p>

		<p class="lettercomment">What I recall first noting about this letter was the grammar and the way it was worded. Given your young age I was suprised by your maturity, so I replied. </p>

		<p class="lettersbody">Dear Henry, 

     I was delighted to get your letter! I am having a good day thank you for asking! To answer your question, yes I am Christian. Most of the time I'm reading a book or playing video games. Fun fact: I ride horses. I live in Alabama. Since I have been taking geography for school I have been intrigued with other countries and cultures. I would love to get to know you better. 

Sincerely, Clarke</p>

		<p class="lettersbody">Hello Clarke!

I go to a private Christian American School and my school is not that different from schools back in the states however I still miss America a lot, tho I have made a few friends here and I’ve even met a few other Americans here so that’s nice. I usually like to read about history and geography and I of course read the Bible. I also like to play video games, which games do you play? It’s so nice to find a fellow Christian, I support traditionalist Christian values and I believe that modernism has for the most part hurt our society and has strayed us away from god. Things seemed to be much better back then for the most part. Stuff like lgbt, progressivism, abortion, and degeneracy is immoral and hasn’t helped us at all. What do you think? I hope to hear back from you!

Best Wishes 

Henry </p>

		<p class="lettersbody">     So glad to hear from you! I play pretty basic games, such as, Sims 3 and 4, and Among us. I'm glad that you are enjoying school, I am homeschooled, which I prefer over public school. I also share your views on traditional Christianity. I feel that most of modern society has interpreted the Bible due to their preferences and desires other than the truth. Have you always been Christian? And if you could have one wish in the world what would it be? 

Best Wishes, 

Clarke</p>

I play games on the PS4 and on the computer. Pretty cool that you’re homeschooled, how’s it like? It’s so nice to find someone who agrees with me, society should change to appease god, not the other way around. I’ve always been a Christian however sometimes it was just in name only and my denomination has changed. If I could have one wish become true, it’d be that we (Americans and Westerners) return to our traditional values and reject modernism. Hey maybe we should move our conversation to somewhere else like Instagram or iMessages or WhatsApp. I’ll give you my Instagram and phone number.

		<p>It was then that I realized I was nervous.Not because of you but because I was starting to like you. Even without seeing your face.</p>
		<p>On the date of October 29, 2020, you asked me to be your girlfriend, after only 5 days I was hesitant. Saying yes was the greatest thing I ever did. Thats how our story started.</p>
